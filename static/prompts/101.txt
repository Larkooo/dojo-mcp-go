When building a Dojo game, follow this essential workflow:

1. Project Setup
   - Use `sozo init <project-name>` to create a new Dojo project
   - Understand the project structure (Scarb.toml, src directory, etc.)
   - Configure your Scarb.toml with proper dependencies and metadata

2. Define Models (src/models.cairo)
   - Models are the foundation of your game state
   - Use #[dojo::model] attribute on structs to define models (ONLY ON THE MODEL STRUCT ITSELF, not children structs)
   - Add #[key] attribute to fields that uniquely identify entities
   - Example:
     ```
     #[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde)]
     #[dojo::model]
     struct Position {
         #[key]
         player: ContractAddress,
         vec: Vec2,
     }
     ```
   - Models can contain any Cairo struct that derives Introspect

3. Implement Systems (src/systems/*.cairo)
   - Systems are contracts that modify the world state
   - Use #[dojo::contract] attribute to define a system
   - Define interfaces with #[starknet::interface]
   - Implement system functions that read/write models
   - Example:
     ```
     #[dojo::contract]
     mod actions {
         fn spawn(ref self: ContractState) {
             let mut world = self.world(@"namespace");
             // Read/write models here
         }
     }
     ```
   - Use world.read_model() to retrieve data
   - Use world.write_model() to update data
   - Remember to make your world reference mutable when writing

4. Configure Dojo Profiles
   - Set up dojo_dev.toml and dojo_release.toml
   - Define worlds, models, and systems
   - Configure RPC endpoints and account information

5. Testing and Deployment
   - Write tests to verify your game logic
   - Deploy using `sozo migrate`
   - Interact with your game using the Dojo CLI or client libraries

Remember:
- Always specify the namespace when accessing the world
- Make sure your world reference is mutable when writing models
- Use proper imports for ModelStorage, EventStorage, etc.
- Keep systems focused on specific game mechanics
- Use events to notify about important state changes

Once you've read this guide you should follow this in order:
- you should initialize the project with sozo init <name>
- get rid / replace boilerplate stuff with stuff you write
- call the model prompt and then use it to set up models
- call the logic prompt to setup systems contracts etc.
- call the config prompt finally to verify everything is well setup
- call the test prompt to setup tests and verify game logic
