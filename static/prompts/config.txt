When working with Dojo configuration, remember these critical points:

1. Profile-based system:
   - Always specify which profile you want to use (default is "dev")
   - Two main config files: Scarb.toml and dojo_<PROFILE>.toml

2. For Scarb.toml:
   - Include required dependencies (dojo, starknet)
   - Set correct cairo-version
   - Configure build-external-contracts for any external contracts like ERCs
   - Use [profile.<PROFILE>] sections for custom profiles

3. For dojo_<PROFILE>.toml:
   - Configure [world] section with metadata (name, description, etc.)
   - Set [env] with network details (rpc_url, account_address, private_key)
   - Define [namespace] with default and mappings
   - List models, events, and contracts with appropriate tags

4. For permissions:
   - Use [writers] to specify which contracts can write to which models
   - Use [owners] to define ownership permissions
   - Format: "<TARGET_TAG>" = ["<GRANTEE_TAG>"]

5. For initialization:
   - Configure [init_call_args] for contract initialization
   - Use proper Dojo calldata format
   - Specify order with [migration] order_inits if needed

6. For external contracts:
   - Use [[external_contracts]] sections
   - Specify contract_name, instance_name (optional), salt, and constructor_data
   - Follow Dojo calldata format for constructor arguments

7. For migration control:
   - Use [migration] section to control deployment behavior
   - Configure order_inits, skip_contracts, disable_multicall as needed

8. Common issues to avoid:
   - Missing external contracts in build-external-contracts
   - Incorrect namespace mappings
   - Missing or incorrect permissions in [writers]/[owners]
   - Improper initialization arguments
