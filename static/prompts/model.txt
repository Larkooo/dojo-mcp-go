When working with Dojo models, remember these critical points:

1. Models are Cairo structs with the #[dojo::model] attribute
2. ALWAYS derive Drop and Serde traits for models (#[derive(Drop, Serde)])
3. Every model MUST have at least one #[key] attribute
4. All #[key] fields MUST come before non-key fields in the struct
5. Models are upgradeable but with limitations:
   - Layout must not be packed (avoid IntrospectPacked for upgradeable models)
   - Existing elements cannot be removed, only modified according to rules
   - Each element must keep the same type, name, and attributes

6. For nested structs:
   - Inner structs do NOT use the #[dojo::model] attribute
   - Inner structs do NOT have #[key] attributes
   - Inner structs must implement Introspect trait

7. For enums:
   - Derive necessary traits (#[derive(Serde, Drop, Introspect)])
   - Consider variant data types carefully

8. Follow ECS best practices:
   - Keep models small and isolated
   - Reuse models across entity types
   - Use composite keys when needed
